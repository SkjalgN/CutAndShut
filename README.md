<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is one of my first projects outside of school and work. Its based solely on html, css, and some javascript, so don't excpect a lot. The project is a twist on spotify.

Here's some key features:
* A compelling frontpage
* A playlist page
* A contact page
