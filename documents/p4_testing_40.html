                <h2><strong>Administrative details</strong></h2>
                <p><strong> Clients:</strong> Kaj-Robert and Kurre Räven own and operates a hair
                    salon on Solsiden, Trondheim. Their salon is called Cut and Shut and serves men
                    and women of all ages. Kaj-Robert has recently experienced a decrease in customers
                    since last summer. We offered to make him a website to hopefully get his business
                    back on track. </p>
                <p> <strong>Website name:</strong> Cut n Shut</p>

                <h2>Testing Document</h2>
                <p>
                    We chose to keep the questions brief and open to get as many as possible
                    to answer the form. Our questions were focused around functionality and
                    design. We asked users to give us both positive and negative feedback.
                    This enables us to understand what users liked about our page as well as
                    what improvements can be made. We also asked them to rate both design and
                    functionality. This is a great comparison tool to get a general image on what
                    level of satisfaction the users had with our web-page. We also asked if
                    they had any suggestions for additional functionality so we could further
                    expand our site if we had extra time. </p>

                <h2>Tester Audience</h2>
                <p>
                    The tester audience should reflect our target audience in a general way while taking the outer side
                    of the range into account. In P2 we described our target audience as “people of all ages” so that's
                    exactly who gets to test our site. By contacting our families we hoped to be able to get a wide
                    variety of both gender and age. We also got to do live testing with Kaj Robert, which is one of our
                    clients.
                    As you can see according to the charts we have reached a broad variation of ages and gender within
                    our families. They all completed the form and left a lot of useful feedback for us to reflect upon.
