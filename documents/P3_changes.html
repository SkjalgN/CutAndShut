                <h2>The changes we have made</h2>
                <p>
                    When we started designing the website, we set out with a pretty clear plan. By the time we delivered
                    P2,
                    the structure was well defined and we had a clear vision about how we wanted the page to look.
                    Thanks to the Figma we created, we ended up not having to change the styling of the page that much.
                    That being said, we saw it necessary to modify some of the javascript initially planned. Below we
                    will provide a summary of the changes, and the concerning files.
                    <br>

                <h4>Changes to the footer </h4>
                Because the footer is present on the bottom of every page, the changes presented here naturally applies
                to every page.
                The initial plan was to include contact information, links to social media, and a stylish logo. As we
                progressed through
                the development, we noticed that the size of the footer was way too big. It took the attention away from
                the actual page
                content and made it hard to fit the rest on the side. We therefore decided to make it smaller. In
                addition, we considered it
                unnecessary to provide the "quick reservation tool" originally planned, so we removed it. The scissor
                logo was replaced
                by the same logo used in the nav-bar.

                <h4>Changes to homepage.html:</h4>
                First of all, we changed the file name to "index.html". This seemed to be a standard for most websites,
                so we decided to go with that. For the rest of the page, we stuck to the design presented in P2.
                <br>
                <h4>Changes to reservations.html:</h4>
                There were few changes done to this page, except for some small differences regarding font-family,
                and the color of the reservation button. We also added a calender widget inside the date-input field.
                This made it easier to collect the date on the right format, and it looks professional too.
                <br>
                <h4>Changes to gallery.html:</h4>
                For the aesthetics, we wanted to keep every image the same size, and with the same proportions. This
                simply
                makes the page more visually pleasing to look at, and we also added a header. There is a image text
                attached to
                every photo as well, to provide information/reviews of the haircut.


                <br>
                <h4>Changes to logo.js:</h4>
                The initial plan was to make the logo change size and color when hovered over. We thought this was a bit
                too similar to the hover effect we ended up with in gallery.js, so we took the decicion to make it
                rotate instead when hovered over.
                Just a cool easter egg.


                <br>
                <h4>Changes to gallery.js:</h4>
                Instead of having pretty scroll effects, we added a nice touch where the image that the user is hovering
                over, gets highlighted.
                To accomplish this we added a box shadow to the picture that is hovered over.
