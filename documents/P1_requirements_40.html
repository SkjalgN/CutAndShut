                    <p>Our Client:
                        <p>
                        Kaj Robert Børve owns and operates a hair salon on Solsiden, Trondheim. He is the brother of Andreas, one of our group members, and a good friend of the whole group. 
                        The hair salon is called Cut and Shut and serve boys and girls of all ages. Kaj-Robert has experienced a decrease in customers since last summer. 
                        We offered to make him a website to hopefully get his business back on track. The website will be called “Cut and Shut salon”.

                    <h2>Purpose and goals</h2>
                    <p>Kaj Robert needs a website that displays his business in a professional and informal way. He wants information about his salon, along with the different services he provides.
                         He needs his contact information and location easily accessible. The site will hopefully also show inspiration for different hairstyles where you can filter options like length and color.
                          Another goal is to make a reservation function that lets customers plan their visits better.</p>
