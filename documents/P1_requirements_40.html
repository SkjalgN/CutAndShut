                    <p>
                    Kaj-Robert and Kurre Räven owns and operates a hair salon on Solsiden, Trondheim. The salon has been passed down for three 
                    generations, continuing the Zohan-inspired cutting style. Kaj-Robert aka Kajjan is a good friend of the whole group. 
                    Their hair salon is called Cut and Shut and serve men and women of all ages. Kaj-Robert has recently experienced a decrease in customers since last summer. 
                    We offered to make him a website to hopefully get his business back on track. The website will be called Cut and Shut.

                    <h2>Purpose and goals</h2>
                    <p>
                    Kaj-Robert needs a website that displays his business in a professional and informal way. He wants information about his salon, along with the different services he provides.
                    He needs his contact information and location easily accessible. The site will hopefully also show inspiration for different hairstyles.
                    Another goal is to make a reservation function that lets customers plan their visits better.

                    <p>
                    Our main audience is the locals of Trondheim city. We target people of all ages and aim to have a broad variety of hairstyles available on the website. The audience expects good reservation
                    service along with a professional and easily accessible website. The site should be pleasant to look at and information should be placed so the customer doesn’t have to search for it.
                    They will also want pictures so they easier understand the services provided by the salon.
