                <p>
                    Kaj-Robert and Kurre Räven owns and operates a hair salon on Solsiden, Trondheim.
                    Their salon is called Cut and Shut and serve men and women of all ages. Kaj-Robert has recently
                    experienced a decrease in customers since last summer.
                    We offered to make him a website to hopefully get his business back on track.

                <h2>Purpose, goals and audience</h2>
                <p>
                    Kaj-Robert needs a website that displays his business in a professional and informal way. He wants
                    information about his salon, the different services he provides, and his contact information and
                    location should
                    be easily accessible. The site will hopefully also show
                    inspiration for different hairstyles. Another goal is to make a reservation function that lets
                    customers plan their visits better.
                    The target audience are people of all ages. The audience expects good reservation
                    service along with a professional and easily accessible website. In addition, the information should
                    be placed so the customer doesn’t have to search for it.
                    They will also prefer pictures to easier be able to understand the services provided.

                <h2>Navigation Structure</h2>
                <p> The navigation structure of the website is shown in the image below.
                    Every page will be available at all times through the nav-bar at the top of the page.
                    This makes for a simple and non confusing interface, which both children and adults alike will find
                    satisfying to use.
                    The reason we chose this much freedom for our users is to avoid confusing “path-choosing” within
                    certain pages.
                    Our page does not need certain pages to be visited before others, so forcing users through a path is
                    not in our interest.
                </p>

                <h2>Page Layout and Appearance</h2>
                <p> When deciding the basic design of the webpage, our group found a minimalistic and modern style
                    appealing.
                    We want to promote a professional hair-salon with an “easy on the eye” design.
                    The beige color palette gives a calm feeling, and modern text format gives a nice flow to the
                    website.
                    The navigation bar is placed along with the logo, in the header.
                    Here you can easily access each of the pages as well as giving a nice overview of the website.
                    In the footer contact info as well as a quick reservation tool is placed.
                    In the background there will be a placeholder image with low opacity.
                    This is to give a touch of hair-salon to the design.
                </p>

                <p> The specific styling for the website that will apply to all pages can be found below: </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Font: “Inter” for the navigation bar (14px), “Roboto” for footer (18px for headers, 14px else),
                        and "Public Sans" for the body </li>
                    <li>Color Scheme
                        <ul>
                            <li>Text and "Kontakt oss" button: #3C3A36</li>

                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Body width: 960px; </li>
                    <li>Header: The header will contain the logo and navbar.</li>
                    <li>Links: The Cut and Shut logo will be a clickable link that brings the user to the homepage.</li>
                    <li>Navbar position and design: The nav-bar will appear at the top of the screen, in a header along
                        with the logo.
                        It will contain: Home, Gallery, Reservations, Contact, and information.</li>
                    <li>Footer: The footer will contain contact information, a scissor figure, and links to social
                        media. </li>
                    <li>Background Images: We will use a blurred picture of a barber, which we will be in a png format.
                    </li>
                    <li>Logo: Our logo will be located on the upper left corner of the page. It will say Cut and Shut
                        and have a modern design. </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Content</h2>
                <p> There will be 4 different html pages as follows: </p>

                <h3>1. homepage.html</h3>
                <p> When users visit the website they will first be directed to the startpage.
                    The page will contain an intro text to welcome users.
                    The interface design is pleasant, modern and gives the user a clean overview of what the website
                    offers.
                    By keeping the frontpage minimalistic we don't overwhelm new users and they get intrigued to
                    continue exploring the website.

                <h3>2. reservations.html</h3>
                <p> The reservations page will contain a user form to order a reservation at the hair salon.
                    Our goal with the reservation form is to keep it as simple as possible while still collecting the
                    essential information about the user.
                    We obtain a name, cell phone number, and email-address as well as when they wish to get their hair
                    cut.
                    There's also included an additional info box so users can inform of any preferences or difficulties
                    they might have.

                <h3>3. gallery.html</h3>
                <p> The Gallery page will contain images from previous haircuts done by the salon.
                    Here users can easily scroll through styles and people for inspiration and proof of competence.
                    This will hopefully make users eager to make a reservation at the salon.

                <h3>4. about.html</h3>
                <p> The about page will contain essential information about the hair-dressers at the salon, Kaj-Robert
                    and Kurre Räven.
                    It will contain a short info text for each of them as well as a black-white photo.
                    The about page is for the users to get an insight of who cuts their hair, and to make the website
                    more proffesional.
